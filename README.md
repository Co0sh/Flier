# Flier

Flier is an Elytra air combat minigame plugin for Spigot. It doesn't feature any regular PvP mechanics, instead giving players custom engines to fly and weapons like machine guns and homing missiles to shoot each other down. It requires cleverness and skill to hit and dodge attacks. The plugin is extremely configurable: you can create customizable games, leverage a flexible class system, define various items with different statistics.

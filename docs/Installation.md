# Installation

Flier requires Spigot 1.10.2 or later. No other plugins are required to run it, although there may be some optional integrations in the future.

To install Flier on your server simply place the _Flier.jar_ file in your _plugins_ directory and restart/reload the server. The plugin will generate its default configuration files. In case you want to immediately set up the example game you need to reqiev the files, set all locations to correct values and uncomment the `default` lobby in _lobbies.yml_. If there are any errors they will be displayed in the console.

Read the documentation at least briefly before creating your own games.

# Flier

Flier is an Elytra air combat minigame plugin for Spigot. It doesn't feature any regular PvP mechanics, instead giving players custom engines to fly and weapons like machine guns and homing missiles to shoot each other down. It requires cleverness and skill to hit targets and dodge attacks. The plugin is extremely configurable: you can create customizable games, define various items with different statistics and use them in a flexible class system.

Flier is an example of a game "easy to learn and difficult to master", both in configuring and actually playing it. You can create simple games quickly (or even use the preset included as default configuration), but you can also create huge, complicated games with many rules and additional mechanics.

When playing Flier there's plenty of room for skill. Hitting flying targets with projectiles of finite speed is really hard, especially since there's no red circle ahead of your target telling you where to shoot. You need to do all calculations in your head, a skill which requires a lot of experience.

# Flier

_Documentation for 0.5.0 version._

Flier is an Elytra air combat minigame plugin for Spigot. It doesn't feature any regular PvP mechanics, instead giving players custom engines to fly and weapons like machine guns and homing missiles to shoot each other down. It requires cleverness and skill to hit targets and dodge attacks. The plugin is extremely configurable: you can create customizable games, define various items with different statistics and use them in a flexible class system.
